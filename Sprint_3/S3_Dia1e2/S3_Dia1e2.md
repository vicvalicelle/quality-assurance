### **Test Planning:**

- **Negotiating a Flexible and Valuable Agreement:** Clearly define the scope of testing, quality objectives, available resources and deadlines, communicate transparently, be prepared to adjust the test plan as project needs evolve, and prioritize tests that will bring the greatest benefit to the product and users.
- **Test Plan:** Document that describes the testing strategy, the types of testing to be performed, the resources required, and the acceptance criteria.
- **Mind Map:** Visual tool for organizing ideas and information, useful for test planning.
- **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:** Descriptions of the functionalities that the software must have (functional) and the quality attributes that it must present (non-functional), such as performance, security and usability.
- **User Stories:** Descriptions of how a user interacts with the software to achieve a specific goal.
- **Pre-game:** Planning meeting before the start of a sprint, where the team defines the objectives and tasks to be performed.
- **Product Backlog:** Prioritized list of features and improvements to be implemented in the product.
- **Sprint:** A period of time (usually 1 to 4 weeks) during which the team works to deliver a set of features.
- **Sprint Backlog:** List of tasks to be accomplished during a sprint.
- **Epics:** Large blocks of work that can be broken down into smaller User Stories.
- **Features:** Specific software functionalities.
- **Risk Management:**
    - **Risk Analysis:** Identification, evaluation and prioritization of risks that may affect the project.
    - **Risk Matrix:** Visual tool to assess the probability and impact of risks.
    - **Planning Poker:** Technique for estimating the effort required to complete a task.
    - **Risk History:** Record of identified risks, their assessments and the actions taken to mitigate them.
- **Test Prioritization:**
    - **Pareto Analysis:** Technique to identify the 20% of problems that cause 80% of the impacts, allowing you to focus on the most important tests.
    - **Impulse Prioritization:** Prioritize tests based on the team's intuition and experience.
    - **Prioritization by Attraction:** Prioritize tests based on the value they will bring to the business and users.
    - **Long Tail Analysis:** Consider tests that, although individually have low impact, can have a significant impact when combined.

### **Test Analysis, Modeling and Implementation**

**1. Test Analysis:**

- **What it is:** It is the process of studying the software requirements, the functionalities to be tested, the risks involved, what types of testing are necessary and what the success criteria are.
    - Review requirements.
    - Identify critical functionality and risk areas.
    - Define the objectives of the tests.
    - Create a list of questions to be answered by the tests.

**2. Test Modeling:**

- **What it is:** It is the process of creating models that represent the tests to be executed. Organizing and structuring the tests in a logical and efficient way.
    - **Scenarios:** Descriptions of software usage situations, including user actions and expected system responses.
    - **Test Suites:** Sets of related test cases, grouped by functionality or objective.
    - **Test Cases:** Detailed descriptions of a specific test, including the steps to be followed, the input data, the expected actions, and the success criteria.

**3. Test Implementation:**

- **What it is:** It is the process of creating and executing the tests themselves. Verifying that it works as expected and identifying possible defects.
    - Write test scripts (automated or manual).
    - Run the tests and record the results.
    - Report any defects found.

**Scenario:**

- **Environment:** The technical context in which the software will run.
- **Situations:** Variations in the scenario that can affect the behavior of the software.

**Unit Tests:**

- Tests that verify the functioning of small units of code (functions, methods, classes) in isolation. Ensuring that each unit works correctly before integrating it into the complete system.
