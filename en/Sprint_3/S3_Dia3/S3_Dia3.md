# Day 3: MasterClass

- DoR
- DoD
- Acceptance Criteria
- Dynamics

## DoR - Definition of Ready

The DoR is a set of criteria that a user story must meet before it is considered ready before the development process. It must have a clear description, an estimate of the effort required to complete it, defined acceptance criteria, identified dependencies and must be decided between the team and the PO.

## DoD - Definition of Done

The DoD is a set of criteria that a user story must meet to be considered complete and ready to be delivered to the customer. It ensures that the item has been developed, tested, and validated according to the team's quality standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are specific conditions that a user story must meet in order to be considered successful from a customer's perspective. Acceptance criteria contain additional information that was not included in the user stories and help ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

## Dynamics:

For this activity you must choose a public API (of your choice, some examples are: Spotify, Github, ServeRest), and based on this API, write a User Story raising DoR, DoD and Acceptance Criteria, the Story can be something that you imagine as "new" in the API or something that has already been developed.

**User Stories**

1. Who will use the functionality?
2. What action will the actor perform?
3. What is the purpose of the action?

**Chosen API:** Spotify Web API

**User Story:**

As a Spotify user

I want the app to automatically recommend and play songs similar to the one I just listened to recently

So I can discover new music and artists that match what I want to hear at the moment.

**DoR (Definition of Ready):**

- A music recommendation algorithm based on genre, artists and popularity.
- A testing plan to ensure the quality of recommendations and autoplay functionality has been developed.
- Required Spotify API endpoints identified and documented.

**DoD (Definition of Done):**

- Similar songs recommendation and autoplay functionality implemented.
- After a song ends, the app automatically recommends and starts playing a similar song.
- The user can customize the recommendation settings.
- The user can view the list of recommended similar songs and choose which one they want to listen to.
- Updated API documentation to include new endpoints and functionality related to music recommendations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- As a user, I can enable or disable the autoplay functionality for similar songs in the app settings.
- After a song ends, the app automatically starts playing a similar song if autoplay is enabled.
- You can provide feedback on recommendations to improve future recommendations.
- I have access to a list of similar recommended songs.
- Can I choose a song from the recommended list to listen to instead of the song that was automatically played?
- Adjust the similarity level of recommended songs in the app settings according to genre, artist or popularity.
