## **Docker, CI/CD and EC2: A Complete Summary**

### **Docker: Simple and Efficient Containerization**

**What is Docker?**

Docker is a software platform that allows you to create and manage **containers** . A container is an isolated environment that contains everything an application needs to run: code, runtime, system libraries, configuration, etc. This means you can package an application and its dependencies into a single container, ensuring that it works the same in any environment, whether it's on your local computer, a cloud server, or anywhere else.

**Why use Docker?**

- **Portability:** Running the same container in different environments.
- **Isolation:** Each container has its own environment, avoiding conflicts.
- **Efficiency:** Containers share the host kernel, saving resources.
- **Scalability:** Create and destroy containers quickly.

**Key concepts:**

- **Docker Image:** An immutable template that contains all the information to create a container.
- **Docker container:** A running instance of a Docker image.
- **Dockerfile:** A text file that contains the instructions for building a Docker image.

### **CI/CD: Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration**

**What is CI/CD?**

CI/CD is a set of practices that automate the software development process, from code integration to its delivery into production.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Code is integrated into the main repository frequently, and each integration is automatically checked for errors.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Software is prepared to be deployed into production at any time.

**Why use CI/CD?**

- **Quality:** Early detection of errors.
- **Speed:** Faster software delivery.
- **Reliability:** Reduction of the risk of failures.

**Popular tools:**

- **Jenkins:** One of the oldest and most popular CI/CD tools.
- **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub.
- **CircleCI:** A cloud-based CI/CD platform.

### **EC2: Amazon Cloud Computing**

**What is EC2?**

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to rent virtual servers (instances) in the cloud. You can choose the type of instance, the operating system, and the amount of resources (CPU, memory, storage) you need.

**Why use EC2?**

- **Flexibility:** Adjust computing capacity as demand dictates.
- **Scalability:** Increase or decrease the number of instances quickly.
- **Pay as you go:** Pay only for the resources you use.

### **Combining Docker, CI/CD and EC2**

The combination of these technologies allows you to create efficient and scalable workflows for developing and deploying applications.

- **CI/CD with Docker:** CI/CD build and test steps can be automated using Docker, ensuring that the development environment is the same as the production environment.
- **Deploy on EC2:** Docker images generated by CI/CD can be deployed on EC2 instances, using tools such as ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

**Flow example:**

1. A developer commits source code.
2. GitHub Actions (CI/CD) detects the change and starts a pipeline.
3. The pipeline builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
4. The Docker image is tested automatically.
5. If the tests pass, the image is pushed to a Docker image repository (such as ECR).
6. The image is deployed to an EC2 instance using ECS.

**Benefits:**

- **Agility:** Reduction in development and deployment time.
- **Consistency:** Guarantee that the application works the same way in any environment.
- **Scalability:** Ease of increasing or decreasing computing capacity.

**In summary:**

Docker, CI/CD, and EC2 are complementary technologies that, when combined, allow you to create more efficient, scalable, and reliable development and production environments.
