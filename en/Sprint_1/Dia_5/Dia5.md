## Fundamentals of Software Testing + Myers and the Pareto Principle

**Test Fundamentals:**

- Generating quality in the product means ensuring that requests are met, making reliable decisions, finding defects and reducing risks.
- Testing is the execution of software to identify faults, debugging is the correction of those faults, and confirmation testing verifies that they have been resolved.
- Test effectiveness and efficiency are crucial to improving product quality and ensuring requirements are met.
- Higher quality leads to faster production and, consequently, higher productivity.
- Testing guidelines include good coverage aligned with requirements and best practices.

**Contextual Factors:**

- They include levels and types of testing, operational constraints, development life cycle, existing standards, and product and project risks.

### Testing Activities

**Test Monitoring and Control:** Continuous supervision of test progress and implementation of corrective measures as necessary.

1. **Planning:**

    - Define the purposes and approaches of the test, identifying the objectives to be achieved.
    - Determine the scope of testing, including which parts of the system will be tested.
    - Establish testing metrics to measure the effectiveness and quality of testing.
    - Detail the test plan, including schedule, required resources, and responsibilities.

2. **Analysis:**

    - Identify the situations that should be tested.
    - Determine what will be tested, including specific functionality, requirements, and usage scenarios.
    - Develop detailed test scripts that describe the steps to be followed and the data to be used during testing.
    - Develop test cases based on identified requirements and scenarios.

3. **Modeling:**

    - Establish the purpose of the test.
    - Describe the initial state of the system before running the tests.
    - Define the input data required for each test case, as well as the steps to be followed during execution.
    - Specify the expected results for each test case.
    - Identify preconditions and postconditions for testing.
    - Design the test environment, including necessary hardware, software, and tools.

4. **Implementation:**

    - Create automated test scripts where applicable.
    - Prepare the data needed for testing and ensure it is available in the test environment.
    - Develop a comprehensive test suite that covers all identified test cases.

5. **Execution:**

    - Perform tests following established scripts and test cases.
    - Collect evidence during test execution, including records of results and any anomalies found.
    - Compare the results obtained during testing with the expected results.
    - Report any defects found to the development team for correction.
    - Record test results for later analysis.
    - Perform confirmation testing to verify that defects were fixed correctly and regression testing to ensure that changes did not introduce new problems.

6. **Conclusion:**

    - Release the software after successful completion of testing.
    - Review closed defect reports to ensure all identified issues have been resolved.
    - Consolidate test closure metrics to assess the performance and quality of tests performed.
    - Analyze lessons learned during the testing process and identify areas for future improvements.
    - Implement improvements in testing processes to increase testing maturity and effectiveness.

**Test Psychology:**

- Issues between developers and testers may arise and should be discussed with respect, sensitivity, and care when providing feedback and discussing bugs.

**Process of Ensuring Effective Testing:**

> “Testing is analyzing a program with the intention of discovering errors and defects.” - Myers.

- The Pareto Principle suggests that approximately 80% of errors are usually found in 20% of the system modules. Where the smallest part of the resources is responsible for the largest part of the results. Thus, if a defect is found in one module, the chances of there being other defects are high.

## How to generate quality in projects?

**QA Duties:**

- **Planning and Requirements Definition:**
    - Analyze and validate requirements.
    - Define acceptance criteria.
    - Write test cases.
- **Implementation and Development:**
    - Review code.
    - Testing during development (TDD).
    - Automate tests.
- **Tests:**
    - Perform manual and automated tests.
    - Report bugs.
    - Analyze the root cause of problems.
- **Launch and Monitoring:**
    - Participate in the pre-launch phase.
    - Monitor quality in production.
    - Suggest continuous improvements.
- **Quality Culture:**
    - Promote a culture of quality within the team.
    - Collaborate with other teams.
    - Learn and adapt.
- **Tools and Methodologies:**
    - Test management and automation tools.
    - Agile and risk-based testing methodologies.

**Practical example in the development of a mobile banking app:**

QA ensures the quality of the bank's mobile app through:

- **Analysis:**
    - Project contexts, functional requirements, supported platforms, security and target audience.
- **Automation:**
    - Creation of automated scripts for critical tests (login, transactions, queries).
- **Feedback:**
    - Establishing continuous communication with the development team to identify flaws and suggest improvements in the UX.

**Conclusion:**

QA is an essential professional for the success of any software project. Through their expertise and proactivity, QA ensures the delivery of high-quality products that meet customer needs and contribute to the company's growth.
