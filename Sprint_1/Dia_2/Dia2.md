## SCRUM Fundamentals ðŸ’¼

- **Definition** : Scrum is a framework that helps people, teams, and organizations create value through adaptive solutions to complex problems. It is grounded in values such as commitment, focus, openness, respect, and courage, and is based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

1. **Scrum Roles** :

    - Product Owner: Responsible for maximizing the value of the product, defining the direction of the project by collecting User Stories and recording them in the Product Backlog.
    - Scrum Master: Responsible for ensuring that Scrum is understood and implemented correctly, increasing the efficiency and quality of the team's work.
    - Scrum Team: Responsible for creating the product, working to make the Product Backlog a reality.

2. **Scrum Events** :

    - Sprint: A fixed period of time during which work is accomplished and a potentially shippable product increment is created.
    - Sprint Planning: Meeting to plan the work to be done during the Sprint.
    - Daily Scrum: Daily 15-minute synchronization meeting to inspect progress and adapt the plan.
    - Sprint Review: Meeting held at the end of the sprint to review the increment and adapt the Product Backlog.
    - Sprint Retrospective: Meeting to reflect on the Sprint and identify improvements.

3. **Scrum Artifacts** :

    - Product Backlog: Prioritized list of requirements, features and needs of the product to be developed.
    - Sprint Backlog: List of tasks selected from the Product Backlog that must be completed by the end of the Sprint.
    - Increment: Potentially shippable version of the product after each Sprint.

4. **Scrum Values** : Scrum promotes an iterative and incremental approach to product development, which allows for rapid adaptation to changes, achieved through short iterations, where the product is developed incrementally, with a specific focus on delivering value to the customer. It is also important to remember collaboration between team members and project stakeholders and open and transparent communication to ensure alignment with product objectives and priorities.
