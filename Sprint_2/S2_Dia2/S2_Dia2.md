- **What is Swagger?**

REST APIs are a way to integrate different systems. Swagger helps in the development and use of APIs by providing clear documentation, testing tools, and collaboration features.

- **What is Swagger for?**
    - **Interactive Documentation:** An interactive web interface where you view and test your API endpoints directly in the browser.
    - **Code Generation:** Being able to automatically generate client code to interact with your API.
    - **Automated Testing:** You can create automated tests that verify that your API is working as expected.
    - **Collaboration:** Facilitates collaboration between frontend and backend developers by providing a single source of truth on how the API should work.
