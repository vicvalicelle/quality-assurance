- Planning
- Performance Tests

## Performance Tests

Performance testing evaluates how a system behaves under different workloads. It ensures that the application meets non-functional requirements, providing a satisfactory experience and avoiding problems such as slowness, crashes and unavailability.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

While functional requirements define what the system should do, non-functional requirements describe how it should do it, the behavior of the application.

- Performance
- Availability
- Usability
- Reliability
- Security.
- Interoperability.

### What is Performance?

Performance is the measure of how well a system performs its functions, its performance, whether in speed, responsiveness and system efficiency under different load conditions, preventing problems and avoiding rework.

Performance directly impacts user experience and business success. Performance issues can result in financial losses, productivity losses, business interruptions, legal liability issues, and damage to a companyâ€™s reputation.

### Types

There are several types of performance tests and in general the objective is to measure performance, capacity, reliability, availability, scalability and resilience. Eliminating performance obstacles and understanding better application configurations and needs to meet these performance requirements.

- Load test: Evaluates the behavior of the system under increased load (simultaneous users, number of records, etc.).
- Capacity Test: Evaluates and discovers the application limit (increased load for a time limit).
- Scalability Test: Evaluates the system's ability to expand.
- Stress test: Evaluates the behavior of the system under extreme workload, close to or above the limit.
- Peak test: Evaluates system behavior under sudden load peaks.
- Endurance test: Evaluates the behavior of the system under workload for a long period.
- Concurrency testing: Assesses the impact on the application in simultaneous executions.

### Metrics

- Response time: Average, minimum and maximum time that the system takes to respond to a request.
- Throughput: Number of records per unit of time.
- Latency: Delay that a request takes to be transmitted from one end to the other.
- Resource utilization: Percentage of CPU, memory, disk and network used by the system.

### Common Failures

- Slow response under load levels.
- Response degrades over time.
- improper error handling under heavy load or over limit.

### Required Skills

Hard Skills:

- Knowledge of databases.
- Performance testing concepts.
- Know the application architecture
- Analyze metrics to build the report
- Know some language for scripting
- Monitoring

Soft Skills:

- Communication skills.
- Flexibility.
- Resilience.
- Cooperation.

### Performance Testing Processes

1. Planning: Define test objectives, identify test scenarios and metrics to be collected.
2. Creating test scripts: Automate the execution of test scenarios.
3. Test execution: Run the test scripts in a controlled environment.
4. Analysis of results: Analyze the collected data and identify performance problems.
5. Reporting results: Document test results so they can be addressed.
